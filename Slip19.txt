Q.1 Write a Java Program to implement Factory method for Pizza Store with createPizza(),
orederPizza(), prepare(), Bake(), cut(), box(). Use this to create variety of pizza’s like
NyStyleCheesePizza, ChicagoStyleCheesePizza etc
Java Program to Implement the Factory Method Pattern:
1. Pizza Class (Abstract Base Class)
This class defines the methods that all pizzas will share.
java
Copy code
public abstract class Pizza {
 protected String name;
 // Common pizza methods that all pizza types will use
 public void prepare() {
 System.out.println("Preparing " + name);
 }
 public void bake() {
 System.out.println("Baking " + name);
 }
 public void cut() {
 System.out.println("Cutting " + name);
 }
 public void box() {
 System.out.println("Boxing " + name);
 }
 // Get pizza name
 public String getName() {
 return name;
 }
}
2. Concrete Pizza Classes
Each of these classes represents a different style of pizza.
NYStyleCheesePizza Class:
java
Copy code
public class NYStyleCheesePizza extends Pizza {
 public NYStyleCheesePizza() {
 name = "New York Style Cheese Pizza";
 }
}
ChicagoStyleCheesePizza Class:
java
Copy code
public class ChicagoStyleCheesePizza extends Pizza {
 public ChicagoStyleCheesePizza() {
 name = "Chicago Style Cheese Pizza";
 }
}
3. PizzaStore Class (Factory Method)
The PizzaStore class will define the abstract method createPizza() that must be implemented
by subclasses to return the specific type of pizza.
java
Copy code
public abstract class PizzaStore {
 // Factory Method
 public Pizza orderPizza(String type) {
 Pizza pizza;
 pizza = createPizza(type); // Create pizza based on the type
 pizza.prepare(); // Prepare the pizza
 pizza.bake(); // Bake the pizza
 pizza.cut(); // Cut the pizza
 pizza.box(); // Box the pizza
 return pizza;
 }
 // Abstract Factory Method, to be implemented by concrete stores
 protected abstract Pizza createPizza(String type);
}
4. Concrete Pizza Stores
Each store subclass will implement the createPizza() method, which will return the
appropriate pizza based on the input type.
NYPizzaStore Class:
java
Copy code
public class NYPizzaStore extends PizzaStore {
 @Override
 protected Pizza createPizza(String type) {
 Pizza pizza = null;
 if (type.equals("cheese")) {
 pizza = new NYStyleCheesePizza();
 }
 // Add more types here if necessary, like "veggie", "clam", etc.
 return pizza;
 }
}
ChicagoPizzaStore Class:
java
Copy code
public class ChicagoPizzaStore extends PizzaStore {
 @Override
 protected Pizza createPizza(String type) {
 Pizza pizza = null;
 if (type.equals("cheese")) {
 pizza = new ChicagoStyleCheesePizza();
 }
 // Add more types here if necessary, like "veggie", "clam", etc.
 return pizza;
 }
}
5. Main Class to Test the Program
In the PizzaTestDrive class, we will create instances of different pizza stores and order pizzas.
java
Copy code
public class PizzaTestDrive {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 // Create a New York Pizza Store
 PizzaStore nyStore = new NYPizzaStore();
 // Order a Cheese Pizza from NY Pizza Store
 Pizza pizza = nyStore.orderPizza("cheese");
 System.out.println("Ethan ordered a " + pizza.getName() + "\n");
 // Create a Chicago Pizza Store
 PizzaStore chicagoStore = new ChicagoPizzaStore();
 // Order a Cheese Pizza from Chicago Pizza Store
 pizza = chicagoStore.orderPizza("cheese");
 System.out.println("Joel ordered a " + pizza.getName() + "\n");
 }
}
Output:
mathematica
Copy code
Preparing New York Style Cheese Pizza
Baking New York Style Cheese Pizza
Cutting New York Style Cheese Pizza
Boxing New York Style Cheese Pizza
Ethan ordered a New York Style Cheese Pizza
Preparing Chicago Style Cheese Pizza
Baking Chicago Style Cheese Pizza
Cutting Chicago Style Cheese Pizza
Boxing Chicago Style Cheese Pizza
Joel ordered a Chicago Style Cheese Pizza





Q.2 Start Raspberry Pi and Execute various Linux commands in command terminal window: ls,
cd, touch, mv, rm, man, mkdir, rmdir, tar, gzip, cat, more, less, ps, sudo, cron, chown, chgrp,
pingetc.
Step 1: Start Raspberry Pi
1. Power on the Raspberry Pi.
2. Make sure it is connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Alternatively, you can
connect to the Raspberry Pi using SSH if it is connected to your local network.
Step 2: Open the Command Terminal
Once the Raspberry Pi boots up:
 If you're using a GUI interface, open the Terminal by clicking on the Terminal icon or
pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.
 If you're using SSH, open your SSH client (e.g., PuTTY) and connect to your Raspberry
Pi by using its IP address and login credentials.
Step 3: Execute the Various Linux Commands
Here is a list of common Linux commands and their usage. Execute these commands one by
one in the terminal window.
1. ls – List directory contents
bash
Copy code
ls
This will list all the files and directories in the current working directory.
2. cd – Change directory
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/directory
Use this command to navigate to a different directory. Replace /path/to/directory with the
actual path.
3. touch – Create an empty file
bash
Copy code
touch myfile.txt
This will create a new empty file called myfile.txt in the current directory.
4. mv – Move or rename files
bash
Copy code
mv myfile.txt /path/to/new/directory
This will move the file myfile.txt to the new directory. You can also use this command to
rename files:
bash
Copy code
mv oldname.txt newname.txt
5. rm – Remove files or directories
bash
Copy code
rm myfile.txt
This will delete the file myfile.txt.
To delete a directory (and its contents):
bash
Copy code
rm -r mydirectory
6. man – View manual for commands
bash
Copy code
man ls
This will display the manual page for the ls command. You can exit the manual by pressing q.
7. mkdir – Create a directory
bash
Copy code
mkdir mydirectory
This will create a new directory called mydirectory.
8. rmdir – Remove an empty directory
bash
Copy code
rmdir mydirectory
This will remove an empty directory called mydirectory.
9. tar – Archive files
bash
Copy code
tar -cvf archive.tar directory
This will create an archive called archive.tar of the specified directory. The options used:
 -c: Create a new archive.
 -v: Verbose mode (shows files being archived).
 -f: Specifies the archive file name.
To extract the archive:
bash
Copy code
tar -xvf archive.tar
10. gzip – Compress files
bash
Copy code
gzip myfile.txt
This will compress the file myfile.txt into myfile.txt.gz.
To decompress a .gz file:
bash
Copy code
gzip -d myfile.txt.gz
11. cat – Concatenate and display file content
bash
Copy code
cat myfile.txt
This will display the contents of myfile.txt on the terminal.
12. more – View file contents page by page
bash
Copy code
more myfile.txt
This will allow you to view the contents of myfile.txt one page at a time.
13. less – View file contents interactively
bash
Copy code
less myfile.txt
This is similar to more, but allows you to scroll up and down interactively.
14. ps – Display running processes
bash
Copy code
ps aux
This will show a list of all running processes. ps aux displays all processes, including those
from other users.
15. sudo – Execute commands with root privileges
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
This command updates the package list on your Raspberry Pi. sudo is used to execute commands
with elevated privileges.
16. cron – Schedule tasks to run at specified times
bash
Copy code
crontab -e
This will open the cron jobs editor. You can use it to schedule tasks to run at specific times. A
cron job entry might look like this:
bash
Copy code
0 5 * * * /path/to/script.sh
This would run /path/to/script.sh every day at 5:00 AM.
17. chown – Change file owner and group
bash
Copy code
sudo chown pi:pi myfile.txt
This will change the owner and group of myfile.txt to pi.
18. chgrp – Change group ownership
bash
Copy code
sudo chgrp pi myfile.txt
This will change the group ownership of myfile.txt to pi.
19. ping – Send ICMP Echo Request
bash
Copy code
ping google.com
This will send a ping request to google.com to check the network connectivity. To stop the ping
process, press Ctrl+C.
20. etc – Directory for configuration files
In Linux, /etc is a directory that holds configuration files for the system. You can list files
in /etc with:
bash
Copy code
ls /etc
