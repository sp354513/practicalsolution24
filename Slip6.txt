Q.1) Develop an Express.js application that defines routes for Create and Read
operations on a resource (products).

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
app.use(express.json());
let products = [];
app.post('/products', (req, res) => {
const { name, price } = req.body;
if (!name || !price) {
return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Name and price are required.' });
}
const newProduct = {
id: products.length + 1, 
name,
price
};
products.push(newProduct);
res.status(201).json({ message: 'Product created successfully', product: newProduct
});
});
app.get('/products', (req, res) => {
res.status(200).json(products);
});
app.listen(port, () => {
console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});

Q.2) Find a company with a workforce greater than 30 in the array. (Using find by id
method)

const companies = [
{ id: 1, name: "Company A", workforce: 25 },
{ id: 2, name: "Company B", workforce: 50 },
{ id: 3, name: "Company C", workforce: 20 },
{ id: 4, name: "Company D", workforce: 35 },
];
const companyWithLargeWorkforce = companies.find(company =>
company.workforce > 30);
if (companyWithLargeWorkforce) {
console.log(`Found a company with a workforce greater than 30:`);
console.log(`Company ID: ${companyWithLargeWorkforce.id}`);
console.log(`Company Name: ${companyWithLargeWorkforce.name}`);
console.log(`Workforce: ${companyWithLargeWorkforce.workforce}`);
} else {
console.log("No company found with a workforce greater than 30.");
}
